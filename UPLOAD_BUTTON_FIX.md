# Upload Button Fix - Collage Page

## Issue Description
The "Upload Photos" button on the collage page was displaying as a vertical blue bar instead of a proper horizontal button.

## Root Cause
Multiple conflicting CSS rules were causing the button to display incorrectly:
1. Duplicate `position: fixed` declarations
2. Conflicting positioning (some rules used `bottom`, others used `top`)
3. Missing explicit horizontal text orientation
4. Safe area support was positioning the button at the bottom instead of top

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Base Button Styles (`.collage-upload-btn`)
- Removed duplicate `position: fixed` declaration
- Removed `overflow: hidden` that could cause display issues
- Added explicit horizontal text orientation:
  ```css
  writing-mode: horizontal-tb;
  text-orientation: mixed;
  white-space: nowrap;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  ```

### 2. Mobile Responsive Styles
- Fixed all media queries to use consistent `top` positioning instead of `bottom`
- Added horizontal display properties to all mobile breakpoints:
  - `@media (max-width: 700px)`
  - `@media (max-width: 768px)`
  - `@media (max-width: 480px)`

### 3. Safe Area Support
- Changed from `bottom` to `top` positioning for devices with notches
- Added horizontal display properties to ensure proper orientation

## Files Modified
- `src/CollagePage.css` - Fixed all upload button styles

## Testing
The button should now display as a proper horizontal button on:
- Desktop browsers
- Mobile devices (portrait and landscape)
- Devices with notches (iPhone, etc.)
- All screen sizes (320px to 1024px+)

## Button Appearance
- **Desktop**: Top-right corner, rounded button with gradient background
- **Mobile**: Smaller size, positioned at top-right with appropriate padding
- **Text**: "Upload Photos" displayed horizontally
- **Functionality**: Opens upload modal when clicked
